                <h3>Define Your Experience</h3>
                <p>Majority of women are not able to define an uncomfortable sexual experience. In fact, a common question sexual assault hotline callers have is “Was I sexually assaulted?”. When women don’t know what to call it, they use terms such as “a misunderstanding”, “miscommunication”, “bad sex”, “grey-area”, “not sexual assault, but…”. Self-blame is common and it’s associated with poor adjustment while labeling what happened has been associated with an increased likelihood of seeking support services and better adjustment. Our interactive tool can be a helpful starting point in making sense of what happened, and defining your experience.</p>
                <p>If the questions feel triggering, alternatively, to take steps towards defining your experience, you can explore common responses, myths, perpetrator tactics and survivor experiences, and more here. A combination of both may be most helpful. Even if you are not sure what to make of what happened, don’t let it discourage you from exploring your options, and seeking support.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionR">
                <h3>Learn the Language</h3>
                <p>If you’ve had an uncomfortable sexual experience you might be grappling with making sense of what happened. After an uncomfortable, confusing and oftentimes traumatic experience such as sexual assault or coercion you might be learning a whole new vocabulary and be unsure how to define it. Women often question whether or not what happened actually counts as sexual assault and this not knowing can hold them back from seeking support and reporting. Understanding key terms and putting words to what happened can be helpful in making sense of your experience. Here you can find a glossary of key definitions in general terms. Legal definitions however can differ based on the locality, don’t always reflect the victim experience and evolve over time. To understand the legal terminology for what happened and/or to seek medical advice, it’s best to refer to the relevant local laws and legislations, and speak to relevant professional advisors.</p>

            <div class="sectionR">
                <h3>Myth: Victims provoke sexual assault by, for example, dressing provocatively or by acting flirtatiously.</h3>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Sexual assault is never, ever the fault of the victim. Sexual assault is often considered to be motivated by the desire to assert power over another rather than sexual gratification. Furthermore, offenders look for signs of passiveness and submissiveness, which, studies suggest, are more likely to coincide with more body-concealing clothing. Regardless, attire or flirtation is not an invitation for unwanted sexual activity, and nobody asks or deserves to be sexually assaulted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionR">
                <h3>Myth: If the victim agreed to go to the perpetrator’s home or allowed them into theirs, sexual assault is a risk they should assume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Agreeing to one thing does not mean agreeing to sex. Perpetrators are often skilled at pushing victims’ boundaries to create opportunities for committing sexual assault. For example, acquaintance perpetrators typically have the ability to convince, con or lure their victims into opportunistic isolation (e.g. his/her place). Based on US statistics, the majority (55%) of sexual assaults happen near or at the victim’s home, and 12% occur at or near the home of a friend, relative, or acquaintance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionR">
                <h3>Myth: If the victim had a lot to drink, she is at least somewhat responsible for letting things get out of hand.</h3>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Around half of sexual assaults involve alcohol consumed by the victim, the perpetrator, or both. This does not mean alcohol causes sexual assault. Rather, identifying a vulnerable victim and/or administering or pushing alcohol are commonly used tactics to enable sexual assault. Based on the UN Multi-country study on men and violence, alcohol was the least quoted reason for rape out of those surveyed, and less so for intimate partner sexual violence where perpetrators have other means to gain access and create opportunities to assault than in non-partner violence. Studies of intimate partner violence too have shown that alcohol plays a bigger role in non-intimate partner than in intimate partner sexual assaults where the perpetrator has other means to get access to and subdue their victim. Furthermore, a person who is intoxicated or impaired cannot give consent.</p>

                <h3>MYTHS: It Wasn’t Really Rape</h3>
                <p>“Believing fight or flight is our only response to threatening situations makes it easy to victim-blame.” – Survivor</p>
                <p><strong>Myth:</strong> If the victim didn’t fight back, it’s not sexual assault. “Real” victims will have bruises and marks.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Victims of sexual assault don’t necessarily have bruises or marks. Perpetrators typically use psychological tactics (e.g., trust, power) and alcohol as weapons rather than excessive force and victims resist passively (e.g., by freezing or submitting) rather than actively (e.g., by fighting). These responses can be automatic.</p>

                <p><strong>Myth:</strong> If the victim knew the perpetrator or was in a romantic relationship with them it’s not sexual assault.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Majority of sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone the victim knew and one in five by an intimate partner. Using trust to create an opportunity to assault is a common tactic used by perpetrators.</p>

                <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Sexual assault is a misunderstanding. For example, sexual assaults at university campuses are typically the result of a basically “decent” young man who, were it not for too much alcohol and too little communication, would never do such a thing.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Most sexual assaults or offences are planned, and typically at the very least knowing, and often intentional. The majority of perpetrators are repeat offenders. Clark and Quadara (2010) argue that whether what happened seems “planned”, “opportunistic”, or even an apparent “misunderstanding”, the steps that perpetrators take to realize that opportunity are deliberate and calculated. They use the resources present in any given situation to minimize the victim’s capacity to refuse sex and actively consent. Studies of intimate partner violence have shown that offenders are able to interpret a victim’s verbal and non-verbal signs of refusal but choose to ignore them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sectionR">
                <h3>MYTHS: He Didn’t Mean To</h3>
                <p>“I excused his actions, believing him to be completely wrapped in the moment, and wondered what I should have done differently.” – Survivor</p>
                <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Perpetrators assault because they don’t know any better, or they get carried away and don’t realize the victim is resisting.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Based on studies of sexual coercion in intimate partner sexual assaults, men who offend are able to read verbal and non-verbal cues of refusal but choose to ignore them. Prevention efforts geared toward persuading perpetrators not to assault are very unlikely to be effective with even multi-year programs failing. Rather, early intervention trainings to influence attitudes and behaviors during adolescence and early adulthood are required combined with training bystanders on how to spot predatory behavior, early victim support to combat victim-blaming and outreach to counter myths.</p>

                <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Sexual violence only happens to women.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Sexual violence can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. Men, boys, and non-binary individuals can also be victims of sexual violence. However, the majority of reported cases involve female victims, and societal stigmas often prevent male victims from coming forward.</p>

                <h3>Perpetrator Tactics</h3>
                <p><strong>Psychological Tactics:</strong> Perpetrators often use psychological tactics such as trust, power, and manipulation to create opportunities for assault. They may build a rapport with the victim to gain their trust and then exploit that trust to commit the assault.</p>
                <p><strong>Alcohol and Drugs:</strong> Using substances to impair a victim's judgment or ability to resist is a common tactic. Perpetrators may provide or push alcohol or drugs onto the victim to make them more vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Isolation:</strong> Creating or taking advantage of situations where the victim is isolated is another common tactic. This can include luring the victim to a secluded place or ensuring they are alone at the time of the assault.</p>
                <p><strong>Intimidation:</strong> Perpetrators may use threats or physical intimidation to coerce the victim into compliance. This can include threatening to harm the victim or someone they care about.</p>
